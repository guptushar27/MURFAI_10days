Day 8 – Voice Game Master (D&D-Style Adventure)
Welcome to Day 8!
Today you’ll turn your voice agent into a D&D-style Game Master that runs a story in a specific universe (maybe in the setting of your favorite TV show/ movie) and guides the player through an interactive adventure.

You’ll start with a simple, single-player story that only relies on the conversation history, and then (if you want) level up into a stateful RPG engine powered by a JSON world model.

Scenario
You are building a voice-only game master:

The system message for the LLM will define the universe, tone, and rules.
For example: “You are a Game Master running a fantasy adventure in a world of dragons and magic,” or “You are running a sci-fi survival story on Mars,” etc.

Primary Goal (Required)
Build a D&D-style voice Game Master that runs a story in a single universe, using only chat history for context.

Minimum Requirements
Your agent should:

Use a clear Game Master (GM) persona

System prompt sets:
Universe (fantasy / sci-fi / post-apocalypse / etc.)
Tone (dramatic, humorous, spooky)
Role: “You are the GM. You describe scenes and ask the player what they do.”
Drive an interactive story using voice

GM describes the current scene.
GM ends each message with a prompt for player action (“What do you do?”).
Player responds by speaking; the agent continues the story based on that.
Maintain continuity with chat history

The GM should remember:
Player’s past decisions
Named characters / locations
Run a short “session”

A single playthrough should:
Last at least a few turns (e.g., 8–15 exchanges).
Reach some kind of “mini-arc” (finding something, escaping danger, etc.).
Basic UI

Show the GM’s text messages.
Show the player’s transcribed speech.
Optional but nice: a “Restart story” button to start a fresh adventure.
If you achieve this, you’ve completed the Day 8 primary goal
